# Weather Alert App

This repository is associated with [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/VQ3G8uWGApE).

In [this](https://youtu.be/VQ3G8uWGApE) video we'll build a weather alert app that will email us every morning if it's going to rain. This way you'll never forget your umbrella again. We'll use OpenWeather API for the weather data and SendGrid for sending emails. Also, we'll use an npm library called cron to schedule the script to run every morning at 8AM.

## Install 

In order to install the application you just have to clone the repository and run `npm install` in the project root folder.

## Run

To run the script you have to edit the `credentials.js` file and run `npm start`.
